    "A Sessionless Transaction is a transaction that can be suspended and resumed during its lifecycle. A transaction is no longer tied to a specific connection. This enables connections to be released for use by other users while a transaction remains open to be resumed later. One use case is with web services, where a user's workflow involves calling individual services for specific tasks, and each service uses different tables for their part of the workflow. Each service can start, suspend, and resume a transaction as needed to complete the workflow in a single transaction, allowing relational consistency to be ensured. Another scenario is when a customer has some 'think time' between making purchases from an online store. During that intermediate time the customer is browsing the site, the connection can be released for other customers to use. This reduces the overall system resources required.\n",
